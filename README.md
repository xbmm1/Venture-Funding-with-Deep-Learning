 As a risk management associate, I am tasked with developing a binary classifier model using a dataset of over 34,000 organizations, in order to predict the success of future funding applicants
### Compile and Evaluate a Binary Classification Model Using a Neural Network
* Design a deep neural network model using TensorFlow for binary classification.
* Utilize the dataset's features to predict the success of Alphabet Soup-funded startups.
* Determine the appropriate number of inputs, layers, and neurons based on the dataset.
* Compile and fit the model using the training data.
### Optimizing the Neural Network Model
* Evaluate the model to calculate its loss and accuracy for binary classification.
* Utilize TensorFlow and Keras to optimize the deep neural network model for improved accuracy.

* Experiment with changes such as adjusting the model architecture, increasing complexity, changing activation functions, modifying learning rates, applying regularization techniques, increasing training epochs, and preprocessing the data.
